[[Features]] - NGO focused core modules

Theres a demand for Volunteer / personel management software and currently there seems to be no viable alternative in production. 

CharityICU is for charity what mosque ICU is for mosques. Alot of modules can be ported over Eg. Marketing, events, etc

Ideal we want the ability to create user profiles so when people are vetted and issued clearance (child safety etc) it can be easily transferred to other organisation allowing for opportunities for placements across the network. 

Also allows tracking for student development where applicable.
