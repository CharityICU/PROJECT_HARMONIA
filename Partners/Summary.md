This is a blanket term for all the charity that we will be working with. Ideal as soon as possible we formalise all these different connections into a comprehensive network. 

This would allow us to effectively support multiple project at the same time and will make integration with CharityICU Software easier. 

this would include vetting and verifying charities (could be done using a partner)
